            At the beginning of this unit we started to learn about Java Script and we learned how to do circles and then we learned how HTML and CSS are related. After that we learned how to move a sprite with our mouse and how it works. Then we learned how to make something move and bounce. We then learned how to style a website. Then we learned gravity and pixel magic which is how to change color and stuff, And finally after that we started our website.
